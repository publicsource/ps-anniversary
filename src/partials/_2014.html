            <h1>2014</h1>
            <p>Our reporters have been recognized locally for their work, but starting around this time, PublicSource journalism began to be recognized regionally and nationally for its excellence. A feature story on a husband and wife who both have cerebral palsy and whose situation highlighted the ‘marriage penalty’ experienced by people with disabilities won a national Sigma Delta Chi Award from the Society of Professional Journalists. An investigation into <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/pennsylvania-police-fail-to-fingerprint-thousands-of-suspected-criminals/">state police failing to fingerprint suspected criminals</a> was honored in a statewide journalism contest, along with projects on campaign finance and the heroin epidemic.</p>

            <p>Mayor Bill Peduto came into office this year as well, and he met with PublicSource reporters at our office. Over the years, we covered his administration closely. Here are some examples:</p>

            <ul><li><a href="https://www.publicsource.org/why-pittsburgh-still-cant-tell-you-how-much-city-employees-earn-in-overtime/">Why Pittsburgh still can’t tell you how much city employees earn in overtime</a> (Back in 2014, the city couldn’t produce reports about its public employees’ salaries, overtime, departmental spend and wage gaps based on race and gender. We pushed for that information and have since produced <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/category/salaries/">annual data analyses on city salary spending</a> along with Allegheny County and the state.)</li><li><a href="https://www.publicsource.org/during-five-years-in-office-has-mayor-peduto-fulfilled-his-pledges-to-pittsburgh/">During five years in office, has Mayor Peduto fulfilled his pledges to Pittsburgh?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.publicsource.org/the-parallel-pursuit-of-amazon-hq2-and-an-equitable-city-for-all-can-they-co-exist/">The parallel pursuit of Amazon HQ2 and an equitable ‘city for all.’ Can they co-exist?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.publicsource.org/pittsburgh-mayor-peduto-discusses-police-reform-black-lives-matter/">‘By being attacked by both sides, I’m doing my job.’ Peduto defends approach to policing</a></li><li><a href="https://www.publicsource.org/peduto-pittsburgh-outgoing-mayor-equity-policing-gainey/">After eight years, Peduto’s record is a mix of bold plans and frustrating endings</a></li></ul>
