            <h1>2015</h1>
            <p>We embarked on an environmental reporting project that put PublicSource on the cutting edge of journalism using sensors. <a href="http://publicsource.org/series/clearing-the-air/">We provided air sensors to residents concerned about shale gas</a> drilling in their community and scientists guided us as we monitored air pollutants before and after the shale gas pad became active.</p>

            <p>PublicSource produced its first data tool on <a href="http://publicsource.org/series/troubled-kids-powerful-drugs/">psychotropics being prescribed to juvenile offenders</a> as part of a larger investigative project that was named a finalist for the national Livingston Award on local reporting.</p>
