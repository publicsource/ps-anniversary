            <p>When the mass shooting at the <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/category/series/aftermath-the-tree-of-life-synagogue-attack/">Tree of Life synagogue</a> occurred — the deadliest antisemitic attack in our country’s history — the region’s journalists all produced remarkable and meaningful work for the community. PublicSource’s coverage helped Pittsburghers and many beyond the city make sense of all the news through a variety of stories that included: thought-provoking and emotional <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/tree-of-life-violinist/">videos</a>; <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/under-his-rocket-ship-comforter-my-kindergartener-coped-with-learning-bad-guys-arent-only-imaginary/">first-person essays</a>; and stories about <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/how-pittsburgh-area-houses-of-worship-are-guarding-their-people-and-property/">security at houses of worship</a> and the <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/what-does-hate-look-like-a-guide-to-symbols-used-by-hate-groups-in-pa/">presence of hate groups</a>. Unfortunately, years later, there is a still a need for PublicSource to continue to be the platform for your neighbors to <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/my-heart-is-in-texas-traumas-long-legs-for-this-jewish-pittsburgher/">share their thoughts and feelings</a> on antisemitic attacks and other <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/east-allegheny-shooting-airbnb-pittsburgh-northside-gun-violence-trauma-emergency-department/">violence</a>.</p>

            <p>A multipart investigation, exclusive to PublicSource, showed how Pittsburgh city employees bungled <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/category/series/b-three-solutions/">police software projects</a>, inefficiently managed federal funds and questionably favored a software contractor.</p>

            <p><a href="https://projects.publicsource.org/pittsburgh-race/index.html">Let’s Talk About Race</a> combined community storytelling, enterprise journalism, design and data analysis to amplify the critical discussion of race and racism. The <a href="https://projects.publicsource.org/pittsburgh-race/data.html">illustrated data page</a> shows how PublicSource merges its data skills with our desire to make information digestible and usable for our readers.</p>
