            <h1>2020</h1>
            <p>Before the onset of the pandemic, PublicSource examined the <a href="https://projects.publicsource.org/true-cost-of-court-debt/part-one.html">insurmountable burden of court debt</a> on some local residents. Our reporting helped inspire local reforms.</p>

            <p>After the world abruptly changed in March, PublicSource shifted to a fully remote newsroom while working tirelessly to cover the pandemic’s impact on Pittsburgh and its residents. We looked at its <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/the-coronavirus-exposed-inequities-across-pittsburgh-public-schools-to-parents-like-me-it-also-revealed-the-districts-inability-to-imagine-learning-outside-of-schools/">impact on students</a>, <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/covid-mon-valley-business-economic-impact/">businesses</a> and <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/a-pittsburgh-doctors-30-minute-routine-to-protect-her-newborn-from-covid-19/">essential workers</a> through stories and a new podcast <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/from-the-source-podcast/">(now three seasons in)</a>. On a daily basis, we tracked the rise in local cases and provided perspective on the <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/worry-joy-ambivalence-relief-dread-pittsburgh-area-residents-describe-the-first-days-of-life-in-yellow/">community’s transition from a mandated shutdown</a>.</p>

            <p>In a summer of <a href="https://projects.publicsource.org/photo-essay-pittsburgh-protests-2020/">protests over racial injustice</a>, our journalists <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/hundreds-gather-in-east-pittsburgh-to-pay-tribute-to-antwon-rose-ii-two-years-after-his-death-on-juneteenth/">captured scenes</a> of unity, outrage and <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/police-deploy-tear-gas-rubber-bullets-in-east-liberty-against-protesters-of-black-lives-matter-march-20-arrested/">harsh tactics used by law enforcement</a>. We also obtained<a href="https://www.publicsource.org/pittsburgh-police-bureau-officer-discipline-office-municipal-investigations-civilian-complaints/"> disciplinary data from Pittsburgh police</a>, showing that while most officers had few complaints, several officers were repeat violators.</p>

            <p>To mark the <a href="https://adapittsburgh.com/about">30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act</a>, PublicSource and Unabridged Press asked local residents with disabilities to reflect on the impact of the law in the Pittsburgh area and the challenges to better accessibility.</p>

            <p>The Online News Association honored PublicSource with an <a href="https://awards.journalists.org/entries/publicsource-2/">Online Journalism Award for General Excellence</a> by a micronewsroom in its international contest.</p>
